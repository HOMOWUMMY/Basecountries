to work with input in react, you have to consider 3 things;
1. Have a useState('');
2. Have a 2 way binding, the value and the onChange
3. Update the initial value and store in the useState
the onchange hold a function which is used to update the current state of the useState. this means the whatever the user types in the input will be shown on the browser
